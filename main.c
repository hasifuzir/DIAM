 * Template for Real-time Audio Descrambler, Second Year Scenario.
 *
 * This template is provided for your use in the Real-time Audio Descrambler Scenario.
 *
 * The template sets up all the important peripherals on the MSP432 for you.  This includes setting up the 48 MHz
 * high-frequency crystal (HFXT), the master clock MCLK to run at 48 MHz, the internal core voltage for 48 MHz
 * operation, the ADC reference voltages and outputting them to P5.6 and P5.7.
 * However, you need to set up the ADC yourself.
 *
 * Most importantly, the template sets up the timer SysTick to count 960 clock cycles.  Every time 960 clock cycles
 * or periods have passed, SysTick will generate an interrupt and the interrupt service routine systick_isr will be called.
 * Since the master clock is 48 MHz, systick_isr will be called 50,000 times a second (48 MHz / 960 = 50,000) or 50 kHz.
 * Any commands or functions inside systick_isr will therefore be executed at 50 kHz which can be used as
 * your sampling frequency.
 *
 * The descrambling and filtering functions should be implemented inside the systick_isr as these are
 * related to and run at the sampling frequency, i.e. 50 kHz.
 *
 * Anything else that only needs to be run once but not repeatedly should be implemented inside the function main{}.
 *
 * You need to make your codes as efficient as possible.  Any codes you put in systick_isr must be completed
 * before the next interrupt is generated.  To see how long it will take to perform all the functions inside systick_isr,
 * in this template, P6.0 is set to high at the start of systick_isr.  At the end of systick_isr, P6.0 is set to low.
 * You can therefore use an oscilloscope to measure the output at P6.0 to see how long it takes the systick_isr to
 * complete all the codes there.
 *
 * You should save the whole template folder in the workspace folder of the Code Composer Studio (CCS).  Then within CCS,
 * "import" this project.
